# Claude Assistant Instructions

## Project State Management

**TODO.md is the source of truth** for determining the current state of the project and what tasks need to be completed. Always check TODO.md first when:

- Understanding what has been completed
- Determining next steps
- Planning new features or fixes
- Assessing project progress

## Git Commit Guidelines

When writing commit messages to GitHub:

- **Never mention Claude or AI assistance** in commit messages or commit body
- **Do not include AI attribution footer** (no "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude")
- Write commit messages as if they were written by a human developer
- Focus on the technical changes and business value
- Use conventional commit format when applicable
- Keep commits clean and professional

### Examples:

‚ùå **Don't do this:**
```
Add user authentication with Claude's help

```

‚úÖ **Do this instead:**

```

‚úÖ **Or this:**
```

```
