# Shopping Agent Project History

## Purpose
This document serves as a comprehensive changelog and decision log for the Shopping Agent project. It tracks all significant changes, architectural decisions, work sessions, and evolution of the codebase to provide future contributors with context on how and why the project developed as it did.

## Documentation Rules

### Entry Format
Each entry should follow this structure:
```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC - [Session Type] - [Brief Description]

**Context:** [What prompted this work session]
**Changes Made:** [Bulleted list of specific changes]
**Decisions:** [Key architectural or technical decisions]
**Files Modified:** [List of files created/modified]
**Impact:** [How this affects the project roadmap or architecture]
**Next Steps:** [Immediate follow-up actions identified]
```

### Session Types
- `PLANNING` - Project planning, roadmap updates, requirement gathering
- `ARCHITECTURE` - System design, technical architecture decisions
- `IMPLEMENTATION` - Code development, feature implementation
- `DOCUMENTATION` - Documentation updates, ADR creation
- `EVALUATION` - Technology evaluation, proof of concepts
- `REVIEW` - Code reviews, architectural reviews
- `MAINTENANCE` - Bug fixes, dependency updates, refactoring

### Guidelines
1. **Chronological Order**: Entries must be in reverse chronological order (newest first)
2. **Comprehensive Detail**: Include enough context for future developers to understand decisions
3. **Link References**: Reference specific files, line numbers, and external resources when relevant
4. **Decision Rationale**: Always document WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was decided
5. **Update Frequency**: Add entry after each significant work session or decision point
6. **Cross-Reference**: Link to relevant ADRs, GitHub issues, or external documentation

## Change History

## 2025-09-09 17:30 UTC - [EVALUATION] - LangChain Integration Assessment

**Context:** Evaluated whether LangChain would benefit the project's AI agent orchestration architecture, specifically for the agent service component.

**Changes Made:**
- Added Phase 1L "LangChain Agent Orchestration Evaluation" to TODO.md roadmap
- Updated BACKEND_SERVICES.md to include LangChain evaluation in Phase 1 plan
- Created ADR template (001-langchain-agent-orchestration-evaluation.md) for evaluation decision
- Added agent service annotation for LangGraph vs custom orchestration comparison

**Decisions:**
- **Selective Evaluation Approach**: Rather than full architectural replacement, focus evaluation on agent orchestration component specifically
- **Performance-First Criteria**: Must meet existing p95 â‰¤ 4s latency targets to be viable
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Keep existing microservices boundaries, evaluate LangGraph for internal agent logic only
- **Phase 1 Timing**: Evaluate at end of Phase 1 when core agent functionality is implemented

**Files Modified:**
- `TODO.md` - Added Phase 1L evaluation tasks with exit criteria
- `docs/BACKEND_SERVICES.md` - Updated agent service description and phase plan
- `docs/ADR/001-langchain-agent-orchestration-evaluation.md` - Created evaluation framework

**Impact:** 
- Provides structured approach to evaluate LangChain without disrupting existing architecture
- Sets clear performance and functionality benchmarks for adoption decision
- Maintains project timeline while allowing for technology assessment

**Next Steps:**
- Begin Phase 0 foundation work as planned
- Implement custom agent orchestration first to establish baseline
- Execute LangChain PoC during Phase 1L for data-driven comparison

## 2025-09-09 17:00 UTC - [DOCUMENTATION] - Project History Documentation System

**Context:** Need for systematic tracking of project evolution, decisions, and work sessions to provide future contributors with comprehensive context.

**Changes Made:**
- Created HISTORY.md file with structured documentation format
- Established rules for chronological entry format and session categorization
- Defined guidelines for comprehensive decision tracking and cross-referencing

**Decisions:**
- **Reverse Chronological Order**: Newest entries first for immediate visibility of recent changes
- **Structured Format**: Standardized template ensures consistent information capture
- **Decision-Focused**: Emphasize WHY decisions were made for future architectural understanding
- **Session-Based Tracking**: Organize by work sessions rather than individual commits

**Files Modified:**
- `HISTORY.md` - Created project history documentation system

**Impact:**
- Establishes foundation for tracking project evolution and decision rationale
- Provides structure for maintaining institutional knowledge as project scales
- Supports future onboarding and architectural reviews

**Next Steps:**
- Update HISTORY.md after each significant work session
- Reference this document in onboarding materials
- Link to relevant ADRs and external documentation as project develops
